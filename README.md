# hello-world
ermace's first try at github
I am the Chicago Digital Humanities Coordinator at Lake Forest College, where I work on a project called Digital Chicago: Unearthing History and Culture. We haven't had much need for github in our projects, but it seems like something I should be familiar with, at leat in the basics of how it works.
